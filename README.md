Objectives:

Develop a recommender system using Apache Spark on Google Colab.
Implement two recommendation algorithms:
Alternating Least Squares (ALS)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) (Optional: for hybrid recommender system)
Generate recipe recommendations for a given user ID.
Focus on prediction latency due to real-world recommender system requirements.
